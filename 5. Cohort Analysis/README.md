This project uses a real-world dataset to conduct a cohort analysis for a subscription model. The aim is to measure the retention and churn analysis.


#### What is Cohort Analysis?

Cohort analysis is a type of behavioral analytics in which you take a group of users and analyze their usage patterns based on their shared traits to track better and understand their actions. A cohort is simply a group of people with shared characteristics.

#### Objective

A business analytic tool aims to analyze and present actionable information. For a company to act on such information, it must be relevant to the situation under analysis.

#### Insight


* Retention percentages steadily drop over time, showing predictable churn behavior. Most cohorts see retention fall below 50% after 12 months.
* Starting from mid-2018, retention percentages appear more consistent and slightly higher for later cohorts, indicating possible improvements in customer engagement or onboarding processes.
* Cohorts such as 2017 Aug and 2019 Mar maintain over 90% retention up to the 6th month, indicating strong product acceptance or onboarding during these periods.
* For cohorts like 2018 Jun, retention falls steeply to 16% within 6 months, suggesting a particularly problematic customer experience.
* By the 12th month, many cohorts level out, and retention stabilizes at low percentages (~20-40%). Retention strategies could focus on this point to improve lifetime value (LTV).
